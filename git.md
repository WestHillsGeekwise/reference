Basic Git commands to push to GitHub
============

### Commit to your local Git:

-    `$ git add . `  "stages" the changed files so they can be "committed"

-    `$ git commit -m "commit message"`  commits staged files to your local repository

### Push to your remote repository (GitHub):

-    `$ git push origin master` pushes your local master branch to the remote master branch

###### Remember that the *$* is the terminal prompt (do not type the *$*)

Getting started with Git & GitHub - from scratch
==============

###### DO NOT perform these steps if you already have Git set up on your computer...skip to the "Create a new repo" section further down the document

1. Create an account on [https://www.github.com](github.com)
2. Create a "repo" by clicking on the `Start a project` or `New repository` button
3. Name the repository "myfirstrepo", click the "[x] Initialize this with a README" box, and then click the green `Create repository` button
4. You will be taken to the main view of your repo - from here click the green `Clone or download button` and copy the "git@githu..." text
3. Download the Git software from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](git-scm.com)
4. Install the Git software
5. Launch Terminal (on OSX) or Git Bash (on Windows)
6. Navigate to your user folder by issuing this command in the Terminal/Bash

    `$ cd ~` (the *$* is your comman prompt - do not type it)

7. Create a folder for all your projects - let's call ours *projects*

    `$ mkdir projects`

8. Let's move into that folder now with

    `$ cd projects`
