Basic Git commands to push to GitHub
============

### Commit to your local Git:

-    `$ git add . `  "stages" the changed files so they can be "committed"

-    `$ git commit -m "commit message"`  commits staged files to your local repository

### Push to your remote repository (GitHub):

-    `$ git push origin master` pushes your local master branch to the remote master branch

###### Remember that the *$* is the terminal prompt (do not type the *$*)
